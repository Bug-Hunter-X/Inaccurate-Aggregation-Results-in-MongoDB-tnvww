# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation framework. The bug arises from an incorrectly structured pipeline, leading to inaccurate aggregation results.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains a JavaScript snippet showcasing an aggregation pipeline with a flaw. The pipeline intends to count the occurrences of a specific field value, but due to the error, the result is incorrect.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected aggregation pipeline that accurately calculates the desired count.  The solution demonstrates how to properly structure the pipeline to ensure accurate results. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB instance and connect to it using your preferred driver.
3. Execute the code in `bug.js` to observe the incorrect aggregation result.
4. Execute the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected result.

## Lessons Learned
This example highlights the importance of carefully constructing MongoDB aggregation pipelines. Pay close attention to field selection, stage order, and the use of operators like `$match`, `$group`, and `$project`. Double-check your pipeline for correctness by testing it with sample data and inspecting the intermediate results to identify any issues.
